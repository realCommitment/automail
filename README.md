The task was to implement an updated system for Robotic Mailing Solutions Inc. (RMS) so that
they can make use of the new robot capability. This new capability will allow robots, when in
caution mode, to have a new pair of hands specially designed to carry fragile items.
In this implementation we wanted to add in the new concept that RMS has envisioned into the
system whilst also maintaining a concise and coherent system that follows the main software modelling
patterns. Our solution involves us adding a few classes and refactoring original classes whilst
incorporating common software modelling patterns to keep classes and methods focused and easy
to use.
We first created a Domain Class Diagram in order for us to get a better understanding of the system
and allow others to easily understand exactly how we have gone about implementing the new
system capabilities. The Domain Diagram shows all the key concepts and real-situation objects
that will be used in the system, whilst keeping it easy to read which supports better communication
and understanding. From the Domain Class, we formed a Design Class Diagram which goes into
greater detail and describes all the relationships between the classes, as well as the methods and
attributes stored in each one. Following this, the System Sequence diagram that we have designed
clearly shows the process that is involved when delivering a fragile item. This diagram shows the
input and output of the system under discussion along with when and where we call methods.
